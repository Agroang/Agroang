I am a full-stack web developer learning <strong>React</strong> (and increasing my <strong>JavaScript</strong> skills!)
I am currently looking to work as a <strong>frontend web developer</strong> but also open to <strong>backend</strong>. <strong>Full-stack</strong> is also always welcomed but I want to keep getting better and better at my frontend skills. I have a strong communicational background so a technical <strong>PM</strong> position is also one of my interestsðŸ”¥
